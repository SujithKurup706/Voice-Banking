# Voice Banking Implementation
With approximately 10 years of implementation experience in Voice Banking (VB), I have successfully executed over 150 VB projects for large banks and credit unions during my tenure with this companys. This extensive experience has provided me with a deep understanding of the implementation process, customer needs, and effective problem-solving strategies.

# Implementation Process
## 1. Project Initiation and Requirements Gathering

The implementation process begins when the Project Manager (PM) shares the contract with our team. Upon receipt, we thoroughly review the documents to understand the services opted for by the client. Based on this information, I prepare a comprehensive Business Requirements Document (BRD) for the project.

Once the BRD is ready, I schedule a meeting with the client and all stakeholders involved in the project. This meeting serves multiple purposes:

- To understand the client's business requirements in detail
- To clarify the client's objectives for implementing our Voice Banking solution
- To explain the BRD document step-by-step, guiding the client on how to fill it out
- To discuss the functionalities and features listed in the document, allowing the client to decide which options they want to enable

After this meeting, the client typically takes a couple of weeks to complete and return the BRD. Upon receiving the filled BRD, I meticulously review the document to ensure all information is correctly filled, with special attention to mandatory items.

## 2. Project Planning and Timeline Creation

Following the requirements gathering phase, I collaborate with the PM to create a detailed project timeline. This step is crucial as multiple teams are involved in the implementation process. The timeline ensures that:

- All team members are on the same page regarding project milestones and deadlines
- There are no conflicts with other projects that team members might be working on
- Resources are allocated efficiently throughout the project lifecycle

## 3. Technical Implementation

The Voice Banking solution is implemented on the FINASTRA data center, located on the Englewood server. The technical implementation involves several steps:

### 3.1 Server Setup and Configuration

I begin by creating a server for the client and deploying all necessary files for the particular core opted by the client. This process involves:

- Making configuration changes on the Linux server as per the client's requirements
- Ensuring all files are correctly deployed and configured

### 3.2 Database Preparation and User Information Import

I work closely with the Core team, who are responsible for:

- Preparing the database
- Importing all user information shared by the client

After the Core team completes their tasks, I verify the database to ensure all data is correctly uploaded. I then update the test URL details provided by the client on the server and configure changes using multiple tools.

### 3.3 Voice Banking Setup Configuration

Two main systems are used for configuring the Voice Banking setup:

- Holly Management Systems: Used to configure the VB setup, including adding numbers and other items
- Cavion Admin Portal: Where I create access for the users listed by the employer, allowing them to log in, generate reports, view user activity, and access other details

### 3.4 Custom Recording Creation

I collaborate with a third-party vendor to create custom recordings as per the client's requirements. These may include:

- Greetings
- Marketing messages
- Stop payment messages
- Maintenance messages

These recordings are typically created in both English and Spanish. I also handle the procurement process for this service, working with the Accounts team to get the invoices ready.

### 3.5 Telephone Number Setup

FINASTRA has a pool of telephone numbers that we initially use during the testing phase. If the client wishes to use this number permanently, we can arrange that. Alternatively, if the client wants to use their own number, we work with a third-party vendor to port the number.

## 4. Testing and Quality Assurance

After completing the configuration changes and successfully connecting to the core, I conduct thorough testing of the application. This involves:

- Ensuring all features work as per the client's requirements
- Creating detailed test cases specific to the client
- Providing the test URL and credentials to the client along with the test cases

The client then tests the application and reports any issues or questions they encounter. We address all issues and answer their queries promptly.

## 5. Client Training

A product team is assigned to provide initial training for the client before they start testing. This training is typically provided once, but given that clients are often new to the system, we often receive numerous questions and requests for additional explanations. In such cases, we provide extra training sessions until the client is familiar with the product.

## 6. Pre-Go-Live Preparations

Once all issues are resolved and the system appears ready for launch, we conduct an internal meeting with all stakeholders to:

- Schedule a set of dates agreed upon by all resources
- Work with the client to set a final go-live date
- Obtain a signed Statement of Work (SOW) to proceed further

## 7. Go-Live and Post-Go-Live Support

After finalizing the go-live date, we:

- Push the changes to the production environment
- Provide Post-Go-Live (PGL) support for the client for the next 25 days
- Fix all issues that arise during this phase
- Answer all queries from the client

## 8. Project Transition

At the end of the PGL support period, I work with the Support Manager and team to transition the project to them. This involves:

- Sharing all relevant information about the project
- Ensuring the support team has all necessary documentation and knowledge to handle ongoing maintenance and support

# Ongoing Support and Issue Resolution

As a Senior Technical Consultant, my role evolves once the application is transitioned to support:

- The support team handles all minor and major issues
- If the support team needs assistance, they reach out to me
- For major issues requiring development assistance, I review the issue and logs to ensure it's not a configuration problem
- If development is needed, I consult with the dev team to understand the code flow
- I create a defect case for the dev team to work on
- I work with managers to approve change requests and include fixes in upcoming releases

# Critical Issues and Resolution: Real Case Examples

## Case 1: System Outage During Peak Hours

Issue: A major bank experienced a complete Voice Banking system outage during peak hours, affecting thousands of customers.

Resolution Process:

- Immediate response team was assembled, including myself, core system experts, and network specialists
- Root cause analysis revealed a database connection issue due to an unexpected spike in traffic
- Implemented an emergency fix to increase database connection pool and optimize query performance
- Developed and implemented a more robust load balancing solution to prevent future occurrences
- Conducted a post-mortem analysis and created a detailed report for the client

Outcome: System was restored within 2 hours. Long-term solutions were implemented, resulting in a 99.99% uptime over the next six months.

## Case 2: Data Discrepancy in Account Balances

Issue: A credit union reported that some customers were seeing incorrect account balances through the Voice Banking system.

Resolution Process:

- Initiated an urgent investigation, involving data analysts and core system experts
- Discovered a synchronization issue between the core banking system and the Voice Banking database
- Developed a script to identify all affected accounts
- Implemented a fix to correct the synchronization process
- Conducted thorough testing to ensure all account balances were accurate

Outcome: All discrepancies were resolved within 24 hours. Implemented additional data integrity checks to prevent future occurrences.

# Handling Angry Customers

In both cases mentioned above, we had to deal with angry customers who were understandably frustrated by the issues. Here's how we handled these situations:

- Immediate Acknowledgment: We quickly acknowledged the problem and assured customers that we were working on a resolution
- Clear Communication: Provided regular updates to the client's customer service team, equipping them with information to handle customer calls
- Empathy and Understanding: Trained our support team to show empathy and understand the customers' frustration
- Compensation: Worked with the client to offer appropriate compensation or goodwill gestures to affected customers
- Follow-up: After resolving the issues, we followed up with the most affected customers to ensure their satisfaction
